# Analysis of Cytology Pap Smear Images Using Two-Stage CNNs

## Overview
This project proposes a pre-trained artificial neural network and a much larger database than its paper base, this
will allow us to obtain better results and a network with more accurate predictions when throwing where malignant cells could
be located that could lead to cervical cancer.

## Requirements
- pytorch13+CUDA (the version depends on your CUDA version.)
- tensoflow 2.9.2
- keras
- opencv 4.6.6
- matplotlib 
- tqdm
Make sure that other common libraries such as numpy works correctly with the other library versions.

## Remark
The following drive link contain the classification trained model and the datasets used for training the two stages. The detection trained model is not provided because it not takes more than five minutes to train.
